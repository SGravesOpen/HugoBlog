      <description>In my time playing fighting games, my playstyle has gone through a lot of changes. The more games I play and the better I get, the more polished my play becomes and the better my perspective gets. One of the biggest things that has helped my gameplay is playing slower and focusing more on the simple things. I&amp;rsquo;m mainly playing +R these days, and this is a big help. However, i didn&amp;rsquo;t get to this point from just playing +R.</description>
