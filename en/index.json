The more games I play and the better I get, the more polished my play becomes and the better my perspective gets. One of the biggest things that has helped my gameplay is playing slower and focusing more on the simple things. I\u0026rsquo;m mainly playing +R these days, and this is a big help. However, i didn\u0026rsquo;t get to this point from just playing +R. Last year, my first year consitently being able to netplay fighting games, I mostly played DOA. DOA has a lot of variables, but it\u0026rsquo;s nowhere near as dense as GG, especially in neutral.\nDOA, you\u0026rsquo;re just playing footsies. There are no airdashes or double jumps. The game is system based, so characters are using the same kinds of tools. Everything is minus, even on hit.\nPlaying a game like this was good for me for several reasons. The first was that it made me focus hard on whiff punishing. The second is that it made me very appreciateive of \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; fighting games where i can actually be at advantage on hit and block. If you can pressure people in DOA, imagine doing that with actual + frames lol. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty crazy. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I got godlike at DOA or anything. I\u0026rsquo;m just saying the game made me focus on skills i wasn\u0026rsquo;t focusing on when playing Guilty gear. And these things are very helpful when playing GG, especially as Order Sol.\nOrder Sol may not have the strongest ground game, but he still has good tools in 2S and 2D along with his amazing run speed. I can play a strong whiff punish game by using dash 2S/2D well. 2S may not be the most rewarding, but it\u0026rsquo;s damage dealt, and the threat of canceling into Rock It or 6H can keep them still after. Depending on what button they whiff, I can run in for a full combo starter thanks to the combination of Order Sol\u0026rsquo;s run speed and his 3f 5K. these options only get stronger and more rewarding the more resources HOS has on the table. if he has level 2, dash 2S \u0026gt; pressure turns into dash 2S \u0026gt; RI lvl2/BHB lvl2. with level 3, 2S will now lead into 130+ damage and a knockdown in the corner with no tension spent. with 25 meter, fafnir is also a dangerous whiff punish because it goes half screen and can lead into a combo for 180 damage at most ranges.\nPlaying a game where all I can do is play footsies also did me good in my patience. I used to be a lot more thoughtless in my approach. I\u0026rsquo;m still not perfect, but I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a lot better by taking things slower and not trying to go in all the time.\nMake no mistake: I could\u0026rsquo;ve gotten better at these things simply by playing more GG as well. It\u0026rsquo;s just that playing a game where the simple things were the only options on the table made me focus on and develop my skill with them. It\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon. Some of the best players of very active/involved games are also incredibly good at the slower/more limited games. There are GG gods who can school you in SamSho, marvel players that will shimmy you in SF, etc.\n","date":"Nov 22, 2021","img":"","permalink":"/en/posts/slow/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"Playing the \"Slow Game\""},{"categories":null,"content":"TalesOfJade is a funny guy.\n     ","date":"Oct 22, 2021","img":"","permalink":"/en/posts/vod/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"God's Gift"},{"categories":null,"content":"Yo!
