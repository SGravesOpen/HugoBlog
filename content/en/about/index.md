Yo! Name's Samuel, although I go by Jushido in most places on the internet atm. I'm a programmer with a lot of hobbies. I play fighting games(mainly Guilty Gear atm),
listen to a lot of music, read manga, watch tokusatsu, used to play some basketball here and there, etc. This blog is just a place where I can talk about my time with my hobbies more freely. Twitter isn't the best place for this kinda stuff, and while Mastodon is better, a blog is a good palce for this. My own little corner of internet to blabber about the things I love when I get that urge to type. make yourself at home and I hope you enjpy my ramblings.
